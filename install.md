## Installing the card onto J5  
  
Your MPU should be working before you attempt this step. There are some situations where you can use this daughter card without parts of your MPU functioning. For example, the new code will not require the PROMs, RAM, CRAM, or reset section of the board to be operable. However, until you know your MPU is in working order, I advise you to start there.  
  
With the machine off, plug in your new card into J5, ensuring that the rightmost pin (pin 1) of the daughter card is connected to the rightmost pin (pin 1) of J5. The J5 connector is keyed on pin 29, for reference.
