## Updating the code on early Bally/Stern Solid State Pinball Games

This project consists of a library & several game implementations which add modern features and deeper rule sets to early Solid State games. The softare is hosted on a custom card that plugs into the MPU's J5 connector. The card allows the player to boot to either the original code or the new implementation with a switch mounted behind the coin door.

### How to get it
In order to update a machine, the operator will need to:
- [Build the hardware](../../hardware)
- Get the library
- Get the software
- Compile the software and install it on an Arduino Nano
- Install the the hardware on J5 of a working machine
